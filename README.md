| Title | My Ex and Whys |
| 1st Description | The movie My Ex and Whys revolves around Cali, a blogger striving to become a social media influencer, who unexpectedly reunites with her ex-boyfriend Gio after a viral online exchange, forcing them to confront their past relationship and unresolved feelings. |
| 2nd Description | The film explores themes of love and forgiveness as Cali grapples with her emotions while working with Gio, who is determined to prove he has changed and win her back.  |
| 3rd Description | Despite its relatable characters and moments of charm, the film ultimately follows a predictable romantic comedy formula, which detracts from its potential to deliver a more unique narrative.  |
